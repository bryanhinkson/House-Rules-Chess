House Rules Chess

This is a digital representation of a chess board.  No longer are you tied down by being forced to move in a certain way.

You can move in any way that you want.  A pawn can move all the way across the board.  

(Not according to the official rules, but according to the house rules)

This allows you to augment the game of chess in anyway that you wish without the hassel of carrying a full board around.

What is coming:

    - A piece picker
    - Cards that alter the way pieces move
    - Network / online play
    - Rules
