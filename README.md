House Rules Chess

This is a digital representation of a chess board.  

There are no rules attached to the game so you can move however you want.  This opens up a lot of doors to different variations of the game.

This also allows you to augment the game of chess in anyway that you wish without the hassle of carrying a full board around.


Now here is how you can use the app:

Creating An Account
    When you first open up the app you will be presented with a login screen, if you don't have an account you will be unable to 
    play online.  However you can still play locally.

    To create an account click the "Create an Account" button.  This will display a third input field for you.  Specify a username 
    (Keep in mind this can be seen by other users so I don't recommend using your username)

    Specify and then confirm your password.  Click submit and you will be brought to the game board.

Signing In
    If you can't figure this one out either you don't have the apptitude to play chess, or I broke something horribly for you.
    Enter your username (Not case sensitive)
    Enter your password (Case sensitive)
    Click the "Login" button

Local Play
    You can play locally with friends without an internet connection.  
    Click the "Local Play" button and you will be brought to the game board.  You will find that some of the buttons are missing,
    this is normal as you don't need to refresh from the server or Specify the end of your turn.  Also the inputs for specifying 
    players are missing as you don't need to find people on the server.

    Play chess normally or with a twist it is up to you.

Online Play
    Playing online is a little more tricky.  You will first need to sign in, at which point you will be brought to the game board.
    Note that the "Opponent Player" input field at the top right is empty, you will need to specify a player from the list to play 
    with them.

    Once you have specified a player from that list you can then start a game with them.  (Currently they will not be notified that a
    game was started so communication is still important.)  You can then start a game by clicking the "Start Game" button which will 
    populate the board in the traditional two player manner.

    Once you have started the game, you can make your move.  Once you have made your move, (or moves as the case may be).  Click the 
    "End Turn" button in the bottom right to end your turn.  

    You opponent will need to be signed in and select your username from the list of opponents.  Once they have done this they just need 
    to click the "refresh" button on the bottom left, and it will pull a representation of your board to their screen.  Once this is done
    they make there move and hit end turn.

    After this point there is no need to press the "refresh" button as the app will check for moves ever 10 seconds as long as the app is 
    open.


Starting A Game
    Once you are at the game board press the "Start Game button".  You will need to select a player with which to play in the top right 
    opponent input field.  Once that has been done you can make your move and hit end turn (if playing online).

Saving / Loading Board Configurations
    Version 1.2.1 of House Rules Chess has the ability to save custom configurations of the board and load them on demand.  

    Saving
        To save a board configuration start a game and then click the lower menu button (This is the button that takes the place of the
        "Start Game" button)
        You will see some new options appear (One is to save a board configuration) Click that one.
        You will be prompted to supply a name.  After you supply a name then the current board configuration will be saved, and available
        to access at a later date.

        PLEASE NOTE THE SAVED CONFIGURATIONS ARE CURRENTLY TIED TO THE DEVICE NOT THE ACCOUNT!!!

    Loading
        After you have saved a board configuration you can load it at any time by selecting the name of the configuration in the dropdown
        box, (this is the name you specified when saving) and clicking the "Load" button.
        
        The board should load with that configuration.  (Note that you cannot undo this with the undo button so be careful)
